Summary:

Sarda Energy & Minerals Ltd. (SEML) is an ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 45001 certified company that operates in the energy and minerals sector. The company's production and sales for the Q2 and H1 FY25 are presented in the attached press release.

Production:

The company's production for Q2FY25 and H1FY25 is compared with the corresponding periods of the previous year. The production of Iron Ore Pellet, Sponge Iron, Steel Billet, Wire Rod, H.B Wire, and Ferro Alloys has increased, while the production of Coal has decreased. The production of Power (Thermal) and Power (Hydro) has also increased, with the latter being seasonal and not comparable QoQ.

Sales:

The company's sales for Q2FY25 and H1FY25 are compared with the corresponding periods of the previous year. The sales of Iron Ore Pellet, Sponge Iron, Steel Billet, Wire Rod, H.B Wire, and Ferro Alloys have increased, while the sales of Coal have decreased. The sales of Power (Thermal) and Power (Hydro) have also increased, with the latter being seasonal and not comparable QoQ.

Overall, the company's production and sales have shown positive growth compared to the previous year. However, the production of Coal has decreased, and the sales of Coal have been reduced due to higher internal consumption. Additionally, the company has experienced a part of all production being captively consumed for production of downstream products, and quantities of traded goods not included in the analysis.

In conclusion, SEML's production and sales for Q2 and H1 FY25 have shown positive growth, with the company's focus on energy and minerals production and sales. The company's production and sales of Iron Ore Pellet, Sponge Iron, Steel Billet, Wire Rod, H.B Wire, and Ferro Alloys have increased, while the production of Coal has decreased. The company's production and sales of Power (Thermal) and Power (Hydro) have also increased, with the latter being seasonal and not comparable QoQ. The company's focus on captively consuming a part of all production for production of downstream products and reduced sales of Coal due to higher internal consumption should be noted.




















Summary of APAR Industries Limited's Proposed Capacity Addition of Continuous Transposed Conductor

APAR Industries Limited is proposing a capacity addition of Continuous Transposed Conductor (CTC) in its Conductor Division. The proposed capacity addition is expected to be completed by Q3 FY26 and will require an investment of Rs. crores 72.55. The purpose of the document is to inform the Exchanges about the proposed capacity addition under Regulation 30(4)(d) read with Point no. 3 of Para B of Part A of Schedule III of SEBI LODR, as amended from time to time.

The existing capacity of the company is 7,350 MT per annum, with a capacity utilization of 98%. The proposed capacity addition is expected to be 7,980 MT per annum, resulting in a total capacity of 20,490 MT per annum. The proposed capacity addition is aimed at catering to the increased demand available on account of the Government's focused prioritization of Power and Generation requirements.

The document highlights the National Electricity Plan released in Oct '24, which plans to add 1,91,474 ckm of transmission lines and 12,74,185 MVA of transformation capacity for 220 kV and above voltage levels during the period 2022-32. The proposed CTC expansion will help APAR Industries' capacity become 3x of the current level, which will help cater to the increased demand.

The document also provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed capacity addition under Regulation 30 of the Listing Regulations read with SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2023/123 dated July 13, 2023. The table below summarizes the key data points:

| Existing Capacity (MT per annum) | Existing Capacity Utilization | Expected Capacity Addition (MT per annum) | Proposed Capacity Addition (MT per annum) | Total Capacity (MT per annum) | Period within which the proposed capacity is to be added | Investment Required (Rs. crores) | Mode of Financing | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7,350 | 98% | 5,160 | 7,980 | 20,490 | Q3 FY26 | 72.55 | Internal accrual / debt | As per National Electricity Plan released in Oct '24, 1,91,474 ckm of transmission lines and 12,74,185 MVA of transformation capacity for 220 kV and above voltage levels are planned to be added during the period 2022-32. The proposed CTC expansion will help APAR Industries' capacity become 3x of the current level, which will help cater to the increased demand. |

In conclusion, APAR Industries Limited is proposing a capacity addition of Continuous Transposed Conductor in its Conductor Division. The proposed capacity addition is expected to be completed by Q3 FY26
